# Classes: Syntax
- Fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class.

- A class is a set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains

- Java has pre-defined classes such as "System" which we used in logging text to the screen. 

- We also need to write our own classes for the custom needs of a program.

<pre><code>
public class Car {

    <!-- Scope of Car class starts after the curly brace -->
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <!-- scope of main() starts after curly braces -->
        <!-- program tasks go here -->
    }
    <!-- scope of main() ends after curly brace -->
}
<!-- scope of Car class ends after the last curly brace -->
</code></pre>

- This examples defines a class, Car.

- Public is an access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with this class. 

- For now all classes will be public
